        <p>The Python Script is invoked as: python3 fileIterator.py &#60;number_of_keywords&#62;</p>
        <p>For the purposes of this demo, imagine a user had a suite of policies and had to quickly locate where information regarding physicall access controls was. Naively, we could open each file, use the CMD+F search function, and manually type "access" into each one. Watch how this simple script automates that process in seconds.</p>

        <p>Well, it seems like a lot of files here certainly reference access! Luckily, we can make this search more specific without sacrificing any time. Let's up our command line argument to 2 and find files that contain both "physical" and "access". The example is fairly trivial, but goes to show how we can quickly up the complexity of our searches and optimize parsing files.</p>
